> ### React + Recoil codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://react-recoil-realworld.vercel.app)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **React + Recoil** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **React** community styleguides & best practices.
